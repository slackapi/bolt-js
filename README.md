A JavaScript framework to build Slack apps in a flash with the latest platform features. Read the [getting started guide](https://tools.slack.dev/bolt-js/tutorial/getting-started) to set-up and run your first Bolt app.

Read [the documentation](https://tools.slack.dev/bolt-js) to explore the basic and advanced concepts of Bolt for JavaScript.

## Setup

```bash
npm install @slack/bolt
```

## Initialization

Create an app by calling the constructor, which is a top-level export.

```js
const { App } = require('@slack/bolt');

const app = new App({
  signingSecret: process.env.SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET,
  token: process.env.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN,
});

/* Add functionality here */

(async () => {
  // Start the app
  await app.start(process.env.PORT || 3000);

  console.log('⚡️ Bolt app is running!');
})();
```

## Listening for events

The Slack **Request URL** for a Bolt app must have the path set to `/slack/events`.  
For example: `https://my-slack-app.example.com/slack/events`.  
Otherwise, all incoming requests from Slack won't be handled.

Apps typically react to a collection of incoming events, which can correspond [Events API events](https://api.slack.com/events-api), [actions](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/components), [shortcuts](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/shortcuts), [slash commands](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/slash-commands) or [options requests](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#external_select). For each type of
request, there's a method to build a listener function.

```js
// Listen for an action from a Block Kit element (buttons, select menus, date pickers, etc)
app.action(actionId, fn);

// Listen for dialog submissions
app.action({ callback_id: callbackId }, fn);

// Listen for slash commands
app.command(commandName, fn);

// Listen for an event from the Events API
app.event(eventType, fn);

// Listen for a custom step execution from a workflow
app.function(callbackId, fn)

// Convenience method to listen to only `message` events using a string or RegExp
app.message([pattern ,] fn);

// Listen for options requests (from select menus with an external data source)
app.options(actionId, fn);

// Listen for a global or message shortcuts
app.shortcut(callbackId, fn);

// Listen for view_submission modal events
app.view(callbackId, fn);

```

## Making things happen

Most of the app's functionality will be inside listener functions (the `fn` parameters above). These functions are called with a set of arguments.

| Argument  | Description  |
| :---: | :--- |
| `payload` | Contents of the incoming event. The payload structure depends on the listener. For example, for an Events API event, `payload` will be the [event type structure](https://api.slack.com/events-api#event_type_structure). For a block action, it will be the action from within the `actions` array. The `payload` object is also accessible via the alias corresponding to the listener (`message`, `event`, `action`, `shortcut`, `view`, `command`, or `options`). For example, if you were building a `message()` listener, you could use the `payload` and `message` arguments interchangeably. **An easy way to understand what's in a payload is to log it**, or use TypeScript. |
| `say` | Function to send a message to the channel associated with the incoming event. This argument is only available when the listener is triggered for events that contain a `channel_id` (the most common being `message` events). `say` accepts simple strings (for plain-text messages) and objects (for messages containing blocks). `say` returns a promise that will resolve with a [`chat.postMessage` response](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage).
| `ack` | Function that **must** be called to acknowledge that an incoming event was received by your app. `ack` exists for all actions, shortcuts, view, slash command and options requests. `ack` returns a promise that resolves when complete. Read more in [Acknowledging events](#acknowledging-events)
| `client` | Web API client that uses the token associated with that event. For single-workspace installations, the token is provided to the constructor. For multi-workspace installations, the token is returned by the `authorize` function.
| `respond` | Function that responds to an incoming event **if** it contains a `response_url` (actions, shortcuts, view submissions, and slash commands). `respond` returns a promise that resolves with the results of responding using the `response_url`.
| `context` | Event context. This object contains data about the event and the app, such as the `botId`. Middleware can add additional context before the event is passed to listeners.
| `body` | Object that contains the entire body of the request (superset of `payload`). Some accessory data is only available outside of the payload (such as `trigger_id` and `authorizations`).
| `complete` | Function used to signal the successful completion of a custom step execution. This tells Slack to proceed with the next steps in the workflow. This argument is only available with the `.function` and `.action` listener when handling custom workflow step executions.
| `fail` | Function used to signal that a custom step failed to complete. This tells Slack to stop the workflow execution. This argument is only available with the `.function` and `.action` listener when handling custom workflow step executions.


The arguments are grouped into properties of one object, so that it's easier to pick just the ones your listener needs (using
[object destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#Unpacking_fields_from_objects_passed_as_function_parameter)). Here is an example where the app sends a simple response, so there's no need for most of these arguments:

```js
// Reverse all messages the app can hear
app.message(async ({ message, say }) => {
  // Filter out message events with subtypes (see https://api.slack.com/events/message)
  if (message.subtype === undefined || message.subtype === 'bot_message') {
    const reversedText = [...message.text].reverse().join("");
    await say(reversedText);
  }
});
```

### Calling the Web API

In addition to the [`client` property passed to listeners](#making-things-happen), each app has a top-level `client` that can be used to call methods. Unlike the `client` passed to listeners, the top-level client must be passed a `token`. [Read the documentation](https://tools.slack.dev/bolt-js/concepts#web-api) for more details.

### Acknowledging events

Some types of events need to be acknowledged in order to ensure a consistent user experience inside the Slack client (web, mobile, and desktop apps). This includes all action, shortcut, view, command, and options requests. Listeners for these events need to call the `ack()` function, which is passed in as an argument.

In general, the Slack platform expects an acknowledgement within 3 seconds, so listeners should call this function as soon as possible.

Depending on the type of incoming event a listener is meant for, `ack()` should be called with a parameter:

*  Block actions, global shortcuts, and message shortcuts: Call `ack()` with no parameters.

* View submissions: Call `ack()` with no parameters or with a [response action](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/modals/using#updating_response).

*  Options requests: Call `ack()` with an object containing the options for the user to see.

*  Legacy message button clicks, menu selections, and slash commands: Either call `ack()` with no parameters, a `string` to to update the message with a simple message, or an `object` to replace it with a complex message. Replacing the message to remove the interactive elements is a best practice for any action that should only be performed once.

* Events API events **do not** need an `ack()` function since they are automatically acknowledged by your app.
