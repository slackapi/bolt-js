# Deploying to Heroku

<div class="section-content">
This guide will walk you through preparing and deploying a Slack app using [Bolt for JavaScript](/bolt-js) and the [Heroku platform](https://heroku.com/). Along the way, we‚Äôll download a Bolt Slack app, prepare it for Heroku, and deploy it.
</div>

When you‚Äôre finished, you‚Äôll have this ‚ö°Ô∏è[Deploying to Heroku app][deploy-heroku-app] to run, modify, and make your own.

---

### Get a Bolt Slack app

If you haven't already built your own Bolt app, you can use our [Getting Started guide][getting-started-guide] or clone the template app below:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/slackapi/bolt-js-getting-started-app.git
```

After you have a Bolt app, navigate to its directory:

```shell
cd bolt-js-getting-started-app/
```

Now that you have an app, let's prepare it for Heroku.

---

### Prepare the app for Heroku

Heroku is a flexible platform that requires some configuration to host your app. In this section, we'll update your Bolt app to support Heroku.

**1. Use a Git repository**

Before you can deploy your app to Heroku, you'll need a Git repository. If you aren't already using Git, you'll need to [install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [create a Git repository](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository).

> üí° Skip this step if you used `git clone` in the previous section because you already have a Git repository.

**2. Add a Procfile**

Every Heroku app uses a special file called `Procfile` that tells Heroku how to start your app. The contents of the file will depend on whether or not you are using Socket Mode. 

Create a new file called `Procfile` (without any extension) in your app's root directory and paste in one of the following, depending on how you're running your app.

By default, a Bolt Slack app will be started as a web server with a public web address:

```yaml
web: node app.js
```

Apps using Socket Mode are started as workers that do not listen to a port:

```yaml
worker: node app.js
```

Once you've saved the file, let's commit it to your Git repository:

```shell
git add Procfile
git commit -m "Add Procfile"
```

> üí° Are you following this guide with an existing Bolt app? If so, please review the guide on [preparing a codebase for Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/preparing-a-codebase-for-heroku-deployment#4-listen-on-the-correct-port) to listen on the correct port.

---

### Set up the Heroku tools

Now we can set up the Heroku tools on your local machine. These tools will help you manage, deploy, and debug your app on Heroku's platform.

**1. Install the Heroku CLI**

The Heroku tools are available as a Command Line Interface (CLI). Go ahead and [install the Heroku CLI for macOS, Windows, or Linux](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#set-up). On macOS, you can run the command:

```shell
brew install heroku/brew/heroku
```

Once the install is complete, we can test the Heroku CLI by displaying all of the wonderful commands available to you:

```shell
heroku help
```

> üí° If the `heroku` command is not found, refresh your path by opening a new terminal session/tab.

**2. Log into the Heroku CLI**

The Heroku CLI connects your local machine with your Heroku account. [Sign up for a free Heroku account](https://heroku.com) and then log into the Heroku CLI with the following command:

```shell
heroku login
```
> üí° If you're behind a firewall, you may need to [set the proxy environment variables](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/using-the-cli#using-an-http-proxy) for the Heroku CLI.

**3. Confirm you're logged into the Heroku CLI**

Check that you're logged in by displaying the account currently connected to your Heroku CLI:

```shell
heroku auth:whoami
```

You should now be set up with the Heroku tools! Let's move on to the exciting step of creating an app on Heroku.

---

### Create an app on Heroku

It‚Äôs time to [create a Heroku app](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/creating-apps) using the tools that you just installed. When you create an app, you can choose a unique name or have it randomly generated.

> üí° You can [rename a Heroku app](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/renaming-apps) at any time, but you may change your Git remote and public web address.

**1. Create an app on Heroku**

Create an app on Heroku with a unique name:

```shell
heroku create my-unique-bolt-app-name
```

or, have some fun with a random name:

```shell
heroku create
# Creating sharp-rain-871... done, stack is heroku-18
# https://sharp-rain-871.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/sharp-rain-871.git
```

After your app is created, you'll be given some information that we'll use in the upcoming sections. In the example above:

- App name is `sharp-rain-871`
- Web address is `https://sharp-rain-871.herokuapp.com/`
- Empty Git remote is `https://git.heroku.com/sharp-rain-871.git`

**2. Confirm Heroku Git remote**

The Heroku CLI automatically adds a Git remote called `heroku` to your local repository. You can list your Git remotes to confirm `heroku` exists:

```shell
git remote -v
# heroku	https://git.heroku.com/sharp-rain-871.git (fetch)
# heroku	https://git.heroku.com/sharp-rain-871.git (push)
```

**3. Set environment variables on Heroku**

Now you'll need to add your Slack app credentials to your Heroku app: 

```shell
heroku config:set SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=<your-signing-secret>
heroku config:set SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-<your-bot-token>
```

> üí° If you don't know where to find your credentials, please read about [exporting your signing secret and token](/bolt-js/tutorial/getting-started#tokens-and-installing-apps) in the Getting Started guide.

Now that we have prepared your local app and created a Heroku app, the next step is to deploy it!

---

### Deploy the app

To deploy the app, we're going to push your local code to Heroku, update your Slack app's settings, and say "hello" to your Heroku app. ‚ú®

**1. Deploy the app to Heroku**

When deploying an app to Heroku, you'll typically use the `git push` command. This will push your code from your local repository to your `heroku` remote repository.

You can now deploy your app with the command:

```shell
git push heroku main
```

> üí° Heroku deploys code that's pushed to the [master or main branches](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git-branches). Pushing to other branches will not trigger a deployment.

Finally, we need to start a web server instance using the Heroku CLI:

```shell
heroku ps:scale web=1
```

**2. Update your Slack app's settings**

Now we need to use your Heroku web address as your **Request URL**, which is where Slack will send events and actions.

Get your Heroku web address with the following command:

```shell
heroku info
# ...
# Web URL: https://sharp-rain-871.herokuapp.com/
```

In our example, the web address is `https://sharp-rain-871.herokuapp.com/`.

Head over to the [Slack App page](https://api.slack.com/apps) and select your app name. Next, we'll update your **Request URL** in two locations to be your web address.

> üí° Your **Request URL** ends with `/slack/events`, such as `https://sharp-rain-871.herokuapp.com/slack/events`.

First, select **Interativity & Shortcuts** from the side and update the **Request URL**:

![Interactivity & Shortcuts page](../assets/interactivity-and-shortcuts-page.png "Interactivity & Shortcuts page")

Second, select **Event Subscriptions** from the side and update the **Request URL**:

![Event Subscriptions page](../assets/event-subscriptions-page.png "Event Subscriptions page")

> üí° Free Heroku apps sleep when inactive. üí§ If your verification fails, please try it again immediately.

**3. Test your Slack app**

Your app is now deployed and Slack is updated, so let's try it out!

Open a Slack channel that your app has joined and say "hello" (lower-case). Just like in the [Getting Started guide](/bolt-js/tutorial/getting-started#sending-and-responding-to-actions), your app should respond back. If you don't receive a response, check your **Request URL** and try again.

---

### Deploy an update

As you continue building your Slack app, you'll need to deploy updates. A common flow is to make a change, commit it, and then push it to Heroku.

Let's get a feel for this by updating your app to respond to a "goodbye" message. Add the following code to `app.js` ([source code on GitHub](https://github.com/slackapi/bolt-js/blob/main/examples/deploy-heroku/app.js)):

```javascript
// Listens to incoming messages that contain "goodbye"
app.message('goodbye', async ({ message, say }) => {
  // say() sends a message to the channel where the event was triggered
  await say(`See ya later, <@${message.user}> :wave:`);
});
```

Commit the changes to your local Git respository:

```shell
git commit -am "Say 'goodbye' to a person"
```

Deploy the update by pushing to your `heroku` remote:

```shell
git push heroku main
```

When the deploy is complete, you can open a Slack channel that your app has joined and say "goodbye" (lower-case). You should see a friendly farewell from your Slack app.
