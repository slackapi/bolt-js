Custom functions allow your app to create and process workflow steps that users can add in Workflow Builder. 

We recommend using custom functions as a replacement for the [deprecated Workflow Steps from Apps](#steps).

A custom function requires two components:

* [A function definition in the app’s manifest](#defining-custom-functions)
* [A listener to handle the function execution event](#listening-to-custom-functions)

Read more about custom functions in the [Slack API documentation](https://api.slack.com/automation/functions/custom-bolt).
