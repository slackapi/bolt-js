# Getting started <span class="label-beta">BETA</span>

<div class="section-content">
This guide will walk you through introducing you to the [next-generation platform](/bolt-js/future/getting-started#next-gen). It will also cover how to get started with your next-gen platform experience with Bolt for Javascript by setting up the Slack CLI and also installing the required dependencies.

### What is the next-generation platform? {#next-gen}

<p class="alert alert_info"><ts-icon class="ts_icon_info_circle"></ts-icon>Our next-generation platform is currently in beta. [Your feedback is most welcome](/bolt-js/future/feedback) - all feedback will help shape the future platform experience!</p>

The next-generation platform is an exciting new way to develop apps for Slack! It is focused on 2 components:
1. **Flexible functionality**: You can now create modular, shareable, and remixable building blocks within your apps that make it easier than ever to connect and reuse functionlity. The primary components of this new functionality are [built-in](/bolt-js/future/built-in-functions) and [custom functions](/bolt-js/future/custom-functions), [workflows](/bolt-js/future/workflows), and [triggers](/bolt-js/future/triggers).
2. **Quick setup**: With our next-generation developer tools, you can quickly build secure, scalable apps. One of the tools is the [Slack CLI](https://api.slack.com/future/tools/cli), which allows faster development by allowing you to create and scaffold apps all from the command line. Another tool are [app manifests](/bolt-js/future/app-manifests), which are configuration files for your apps that can be shared and reused to quickly set up applications.

#### Limitations

Today, Bolt for Javascript supports app development using next-gen platform features like Functions and Workflows and tools such as the Slack CLI alongside all current generally available Slack Platform features.

We do not yet support deployment to secure and managed Slack infrastructure or Datastores API [Datastores](https://api.slack.com/future/datastores) functionality.

If you'd like to deploy your app with Slack infrastructure, consider building your next-generation application with the Deno Slack API. You can get started with that [here](https://api.slack.com/future/get-started).

### Setting up the CLI {#setting-up-cli}

To build a next-generation app with Bolt for Javascript, you'll first need to get the Slack CLI set up on your machine. You can follow the [Quickstart Guide](https://api.slack.com/future/quickstart) to get instructions on how to manually or automatically install it based on your operating system. 

Since we won't be using Deno to build or migrate our next-generation app, you can skip any instructions related to installing Deno or creating an app using a Deno template. Once you've logged into the CLI using `slack login` and verified your login using `slack auth list`, you can proceed with the instructions in this guide.

> ðŸ’¡ When logging into a workspace using the CLI, we recommend using a workspace where you won't disrupt real work getting done. Currently the new Slack Platform beta is only available for workspaces on a paid plan.

---

### Install dependencies {#install-dependencies}

Once the CLI is set up, make sure your machine has the most recent version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Depending on what operating system your machine uses, you can either install Node through a package manager (such as [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for Mac) or directly from the website.

### Accept the Beta Terms of Service {#accept-tos}

In order to use the next-generation platform features, you'll need to accept a Terms of Service for Slack Platform Beta. To do so, go to the Workspace Settings of the workspace you'll be developing with, then go to the Permissions tab. Find the "Slack Platform Beta" heading, then select the checkbox that says "I have read and agree to the Slack Platform Beta Service Terms" and save the section. Once you have accepted, the section will look like this:

![Beta Terms of Service](../assets/beta-tos-future.png "Beta Terms of Service")

> ðŸ’¡ You must be an admin of your workspace to be able to access the Workspace Settings and accept the Terms of Service.

### Next steps {#next-steps}

Congratulations! You're now ready to start building using the [next-generation Platform](/bolt-js/future/getting-started#next-gen). ðŸŽ‰ You can now proceed with either [creating a new app](/bolt-js/future/create-new-app) or [migrating an existing app](/bolt-js/future/migrate-existing-app).
