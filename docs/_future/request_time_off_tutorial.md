# Request time off app tutorial <span class="label-beta">BETA</span>

<div class="section-content">
This guide will walk you through how to create a new [next-generation](/bolt-js/future/getting-started#next-gen) app with Bolt for JavaScript. The application built in this tutorial will be a more complex "Request Time Off" app that allows a user to submit requests for time off, which then sends a message to their manager, who can either approve or deny the request.

![Request Time Off app](../assets/take-your-time-demo.gif "Request Time Off app")

When you‚Äôre finished, you‚Äôll have this ‚ö°Ô∏è[Bolt for JavaScript Request Time Off app](https://github.com/slack-samples/bolt-js-request-time-off) to run, modify, and make your own.

If you'd like to create a simpler next-generation Bolt for JavaScript application or are looking to quickstart with a simple template, follow the [Getting Started guide](/bolt-js/future/getting-started#create-app).

If you already have an existing Bolt for JavaScript application that you'd like to setup an existing app with the next-generation platform, check out the [Setup guide](/bolt-js/future/setup-existing-app) instead.
</div>

### Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

In order to create your app, make sure you've first followed all steps up to the "Accept the Beta Terms of Service" section in the [Getting Started guide](/bolt-js/future/getting-started) to set up and install the dependencies.

---

### Create an app {#create-an-app}

Before you start developing with Bolt, you'll want to create a Slack app. 

To create the app, you'll run the following command:
```
slack create my-app -t slack-samples/bolt-js-request-time-off
```
This command creates an app through the CLI by cloning a specified template. In this case, the template is the [Bolt for JavaScript Request Time Off](https://github.com/slack-samples/bolt-js-request-time-off) application. 

The application will take a few moments to set up and clone the repository. Once the app is successfully created, you should see a message like this:
```
‚ú® my-app successfully created

üß≠ Explore your project's README.md for documentation and code samples, and at any time run slack help to display a list of available commands

üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Follow the steps below to try out your new project

1Ô∏è‚É£  Change into your project directory with: cd my-app

2Ô∏è‚É£  Develop locally and see changes in real-time with: slack run

3Ô∏è‚É£  When you're ready to deploy for production use: slack deploy

üîî If you leave the workspace, you won‚Äôt be able to manage any apps you‚Äôve deployed to it. Apps you deploy will belong to the workspace even if you leave the workspace
```

You can now explore the `my-app` directory!

---
### Set up your trigger {#setup-trigger}

This app comes with preexisting functionality - functions, workflows and a trigger set up to kick things off. Let's run a command to initialize that trigger via the CLI.

First, make sure you're in the project directory in your command line: `cd my-app`

Then, run the following command to create a trigger:
```
slack triggers create --trigger-def "triggers/link-shortcut.json"      
```

The above command will create a trigger for the selected workspace. Make sure to select the workspace you want and that it is appended by `(dev)`. This will create a dev instance of your app. Once the trigger is successfully created, you should see an output like this:

```
‚ö° Trigger created
   Trigger ID:   [ID]
   Trigger Type: shortcut
   Trigger Name: Take Your Time
   URL: https://slack.com/shortcuts/[ID]/[Some ID]
```
The provided URL will be what you use to run your trigger. Copy this URL and save it somewhere; you'll need it for later.

---
### Run your app {#run-your-app}

Now that your app and trigger are successfully created, let's try running it!

Run `slack run` to start up the app. Executing `slack run` starts a local development server, syncing changes to your workspace's development version of your app.

You'll be prompted to select a workspace to install the app to&mdash;select the development instance of your workspace (you'll know it's the development version because the name has the string `(dev)` appended).

> üí° If you don't see the workspace you'd like to use in the list, you can `CTRL + C` out of the `slack run` command and run `slack auth login`. This will allow you to authenticate in your desired workspace to have it show up in the list for `slack run`.

Once the app is successfully run, you'll see output in your Terminal to indicate it's running, similar to what you would see with any other Bolt for JavaScript app. You can search for the `‚ö°Ô∏è Bolt app is running! ‚ö°Ô∏è` message to make sure that your app has successfully started up.
### Trigger your app's workflow {#trigger-workflow}

With your app running, access your workspace and paste the URL from the trigger you created in the previous step into a message in a public channel.

> üí° App triggers are automatically saved as a channel bookmark under "Workflows" for easy access.

Send the message and click the "Run" button that appears. A modal will appear prompting you to enter information to request time off. To test your app properly, we recommend entering your own Slack username in the "Manager" field.

![Request Time Off modal](../assets/take-your-time-modal.png "Request Time Off modal")

Then, submit the form. You should receive a message from the app with information about the requested time off as well as an "Approve" and "Deny" button. Once either button is selected, you should then receive a message from the app notifying you of the status of your request.

The full app flow can be seen here:
![Request Time Off app](../assets/take-your-time-demo.gif "Request Time Off app")

Now we have a working instance of the app in your workspace and you've seen it in action! You can start exploring on your own and dive into the code yourself here or follow along as we break down this app's next-gen components below to see how everything works!

### Workflows {#workflows}

Workflows are a set of processing steps that are executed in order. Every workflow step consists of either a [built-in function](/bolt-js/future/built-in-functions) or [custom function](/bolt-js/future/custom-functions). Workflows can be configured to run without any user input, or they can wait for input via form before continuing.

In the Request Time Off application, the Time Off Request workflow is defined in `manifest/workflows/time-off-request.js`. The general structure of a workflow is to first define it using the built in function `DefineWorkflow`:

```js
const { DefineWorkflow, Schema } = require('@slack/bolt');

const TimeOffWorkflow = DefineWorkflow({
  callback_id: 'time_off_request_wf',
  title: 'Time Off Request Workflow',
  input_parameters: {
    properties: {
      interactivity: {
        type: Schema.slack.types.interactivity,
      },
    },
    required: [],
  },
});

module.exports = { TimeOffWorkflow };
```

Here we want our workflow to take in user input, like form data. To do this we will need to pass in `interactivity` as one of the workflow's `input_parameters` under `properties`. This will allow the form to be interacted with.

With our workflow defined, we can start by adding steps to it, which will execute additional functionality in your workflow. Steps are executed in the order you defined them. For the Time Off Request workflow, the first step will be a form that will allow the user to enter in their time off request.

```js
const step1 = TimeOffWorkflow.addStep(
  Schema.slack.functions.OpenForm,
  {
    title: 'Request Time Off',
    submit_label: 'Request',
    description: 'Please describe your request',
    interactivity: TimeOffWorkflow.inputs.interactivity,
    fields: {
      required: ['manager', 'start_date', 'end_date'],
      elements: [
        {
          name: 'manager',
          title: 'Manager',
          type: Schema.slack.types.user_id,
        },
        {
          name: 'start_date',
          title: 'Start Date',
          type: Schema.slack.types.timestamp,
        },
        {
          name: 'end_date',
          title: 'End Date',
          type: Schema.slack.types.timestamp,
        },
      ],
    },
  },
);
```

In the past, to open a form in a modal, you'd use our `client.views.open` method and pass it some custom Block Kit for formatting. Now you can simplify this step with a built-in function, OpenForm and Slack will take care of the formatting. 

This step uses the built-in function [OpenForm](https://api.slack.com/future/functions#open-a-form) and initializes expected inputs of the form, which are defined by [Slack types](https://api.slack.com/future/types), such as the `timestamp` type, which represents dates and times. The Time Off Request form contains a `manager`, `start_date`, and `end_date` field, all of which are required inputs to submit the form.

After the form is submitted, another workflow step handles the information that was submitted in this form. In our example, after the requester submits, we want to send a message to their manager to notify them of the request and allow them to approve or deny the request through the message. Since this functionality does not exist as a built-in function, let's write our own custom function to do this work. In our workflow, we'll call it `ApprovalFunction`:

```js
TimeOffWorkflow.addStep(ApprovalFunction, {
  employee: TimeOffWorkflow.inputs.interactivity.interactor.id,
  manager: step1.outputs.fields.manager,
  start_date: step1.outputs.fields.start_date,
  end_date: step1.outputs.fields.end_date,
});
```

This step passes in a custom `ApprovalFunction` as well as inputs from the form in the first workflow step: `manager`, `start_date`, and `end_date`. It also passes in the `employee` ID by using the `interactivity` property's `interactor` ID, which comes from the initial definition of the `TimeOffWorkflow`.

Once the function step is executed, that will be the end of the workflow! All remaining functionality, such as notifying the requester whether their request was approved or denied, will be executed using the `ApprovalFunction` and its related action handlers. The `ApprovalFunction` definition and implementation will be covered in the [functions](#functions) section below.

The final workflow file will look like this:
```js
// /manifest/workflows/time-off-request.js
const { DefineWorkflow, Schema } = require('@slack/bolt');
// this function will live in manifest/functions/approval.js
const { ApprovalFunction } = require('../functions/approval');

const TimeOffWorkflow = DefineWorkflow({
  callback_id: 'time_off_request_wf',
  title: 'Time Off Request Workflow',
  input_parameters: {
    properties: {
      interactivity: {
        type: Schema.slack.types.interactivity,
      },
    },
    required: [],
  },
});

const step1 = TimeOffWorkflow.addStep(
  Schema.slack.functions.OpenForm,
  {
    title: 'Request Time Off',
    submit_label: 'Request',
    description: 'Please describe your request',
    interactivity: TimeOffWorkflow.inputs.interactivity,
    fields: {
      required: ['manager', 'start_date', 'end_date'],
      elements: [
        {
          name: 'manager',
          title: 'Manager',
          type: Schema.slack.types.user_id,
        },
        {
          name: 'start_date',
          title: 'Start Date',
          type: Schema.slack.types.timestamp,
        },
        {
          name: 'end_date',
          title: 'End Date',
          type: Schema.slack.types.timestamp,
        },
      ],
    },
  },
);

TimeOffWorkflow.addStep(ApprovalFunction, {
  employee: TimeOffWorkflow.inputs.interactivity.interactor.id,
  manager: step1.outputs.fields.manager,
  start_date: step1.outputs.fields.start_date,
  end_date: step1.outputs.fields.end_date,
});

module.exports = { TimeOffWorkflow };
```

### Link triggers {#link-triggers}

All workflows are invoked by triggers. We used a trigger config file defined at `triggers/link-shortcut.json`, and a CLI command to initialize it for our app. The next-gen platform supports many different kinds of triggers, and for this application, we use a simple [link trigger](https://api.slack.com/future/triggers/link).

Try adding this URL as a bookmark to a channel or posting it in a message somewhere public!

### Functions {#functions}

Functions are building blocks of automation that accept inputs, perform some calculations, and provide outputs. Functions are added as steps in [workflows](/bolt-js/future/workflows).

There are two types of functions: [built-in functions](/bolt-js/future/built-in-functions), which are Slack native actions defined in the Schema, such as sending messages, and [custom functions](/bolt-js/future/custom-functions), which are not built-in and are defined by the developer.

In the Request Time Off application, we use one custom function, `ApprovalFunction`, which we passed into our Time Off workflow as the second step after a requester submits time off information. At this point, our custom function will take that information and then send it to the manager to approve or deny.

Our `ApprovalFunction` is defined in `manifest/functions/approval.js`. Custom functions are defined using `DefineFunction`.
```js
// manifest/functions/approval.js
const { DefineFunction, Schema } = require('@slack/bolt');

const ApprovalFunction = DefineFunction({
  callback_id: 'review_approval',
  title: 'Approval Function',
  description: 'Get approval for a request',
  input_parameters: {
    properties: {
      employee: {
        type: Schema.slack.types.user_id,
        description: 'Requester',
      },
      manager: {
        type: Schema.slack.types.user_id,
        description: 'Manager',
      },
      start_date: {
        type: Schema.slack.types.timestamp,
        description: 'Start Date',
      },
      end_date: {
        type: Schema.slack.types.timestamp,
        description: 'End Date',
      },
    },
    required: [
      'employee',
      'manager',
      'start_date',
      'end_date',
    ],
  },
  output_parameters: {
    properties: {},
    required: [],
  },
});

module.exports = { ApprovalFunction };
```
Within `ApprovalFunction`'s definition, we are declaring expected input and output parameters. We are also adding some additional metadata about our function, like a `title` and `description`.

Parameters for the function are typed using [types from Slack's schema](https://api.slack.com/future/types), such as having the `user_id` type for the `employee` parameter.

Once the function is defined, we need to create a listener for it to perform any desired functionality. In this case, our desired functionality is to send the inputted manager the time off request as a message.

The function listener is declared in the file [`listeners/functions/request-approval.js`](https://github.com/slack-samples/bolt-js-request-time-off/blob/main/listeners/functions/request-approval.js).

In the `request-approval.js` file, we are defining a handler function, `notifyApprover`, that our listener will run when the `ApprovalFunction` is invoked. `notifyApprover` takes in the provided parameters from the function and calls the API method [`client.chat.postMessage`](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage) to send a [Block Kit](https://api.slack.com/block-kit) message with the submitted time off information to the manager. Additional buttons to approve or deny the request are also added in to the message Block Kit&mdash;these will be handled by [Action](#action) handlers that are covered in the next section.

This `notifyApprover` handler function is then passed in to a new `SlackFunction` registration so that it will be called when the `ApprovalFunction is invoked:
```js
const requestApprovalFunc = new SlackFunction(ApprovalFunction.id, notifyApprover);
```

Although the function listener has been declared, we now need to register the listener in the application. This is done in `listeners/functions/index.js`:
```js
// listeners/functions/index.js
const { requestApprovalFunc } = require('./request-approval');

// Register a complete function
module.exports.register = (app) => {
  app.function(requestApprovalFunc);
  // Register another function here
};
```
The `index.js` file imports the `requestApprovalFunc` functionality and registers it as a valid `function` to the `app`.

To learn more about custom functions, you can view the documentation [here](/bolt-js/future/custom-functions).

---
### Actions {#actions}

Now that our function listener has been initialized and registered, we can add in [action handlers](/bolt-js/concepts#action-listening) for our "Approve" and "Deny" buttons in the message sent to the manager.

The action handlers will carry out the remaining functionality in the app. This will be to hide the "Approve" and "Deny" buttons once one is selected by the manager and also to send a message to the requester notifying them whether their time off has been approved.

We have two different handlers, one for each potential action&mdash;an Approval Action (found in `listeners/functions/actions/approve-action.js`) and a Deny Action (found in `listeners/functions/actions/deny-action.js`). Both Actions look very similar because they handle similar functionality, with the main difference being the content of the message Block Kits that are surfaced to the manager and requester after approving or denying.

The Approval Action looks like this:
```js
// listeners/functions/actions/approve-action.js
const approveActionHandler = async ({ ack, client, body, complete }) => {
  const { manager, employee, start_date, end_date } = body.function_data.inputs;
  const { channel_id, message_ts } = body.container;
  const startDate = new Date(start_date * 1000).toDateString();
  const endDate = new Date(end_date * 1000).toDateString();

  try {
    await ack();
    await client.chat.postMessage({
      channel: employee,
      text: `:white_check_mark: Time-off request for ${startDate} to ${endDate} approved by <@${manager}>`,
      blocks: [{
        type: 'context',
        elements: [
          {
            type: 'mrkdwn',
            text: `:white_check_mark: Time-off request for ${startDate} to ${endDate} approved by <@${manager}>`,
          },
        ],
      }],
    });

    // Update the manager's message to remove the buttons and reflect the approval state.
    await client.chat.update({
      channel: channel_id,
      ts: message_ts,
      text: 'A new time-off request has been submitted.',
      blocks: [
        {
          type: 'header',
          text: {
            type: 'plain_text',
            text: 'A new time-off request has been submitted',
          },
        },
        {
          type: 'section',
          text: {
            type: 'mrkdwn',
            text: `*From:* <@${employee}>`,
          },
        },
        {
          type: 'section',
          text: {
            type: 'mrkdwn',
            text: `*Dates:* ${startDate} to ${endDate}`,
          },
        },
      ],
    });
    complete();
  } catch (error) {
    complete({ error: `\nError Message: ${error}` });
  }
};

module.exports = { approveActionHandler };
```

This handler first deconstructs necessary data from the request `body`'s function data inputs, such as `manager`, `employee`, `start_date`, and `end_date`. It also pulls the `channel_id` and `message_ts` from the body's container to be able to update the message that as been sent to the manager.

Then, the function acknowledges the request by using `ack()` and uses `client.chat.postMessage` to send the user a message notifying them of their time off status as well as `client.chat.update` to update the original time off request sent to the manager to remove the "Approve" and "Deny" buttons and reflect the current request state. The handler is then completed by calling `complete()`, which signifies that the full flow is done. 

Once the handler has been initialized, it can be added in as additional functionality in the function listener in `listeners/functions/request-approval.js`. The action handlers are added in after the `SlackFunction` registration in this file to add additional interactivity handlers to this function instance.

```js
// Get our action handlers
const { approveActionHandler } = require('./actions/approve-action');
const { denyActionHandler } = require('./actions/deny-action');

// Add additional interactivity handlers
requestApprovalFunc
  .action('approve_request', approveActionHandler) // Support Regex
  .action({ action_id: /deny_*.+/ }, denyActionHandler); // Support constraint object
```
The Approve and Deny action handlers are imported in and then added as actions to the function registration, `requestApprovalFunc`.

The full `request-approval.js` function will look like this:
```js
// listeners/functions/request-approval.js
const { SlackFunction } = require('@slack/bolt');

// Get our Approval function from the manifest!
const { ApprovalFunction } = require('../../manifest/functions/approval');

// Here is the work we want to do!
const notifyApprover = async ({ event, client, complete }) => {
  const { manager, employee, end_date, start_date } = event.inputs;
  const startDate = new Date(start_date * 1000).toDateString();
  const endDate = new Date(end_date * 1000).toDateString();

  try {
    await client.chat.postMessage({
      channel: manager,
      text: 'A new time-off request has been submitted.',
      blocks: [
        {
          type: 'header',
          text: {
            type: 'plain_text',
            text: 'A new time-off request has been submitted',
          },
        },
        {
          type: 'section',
          text: {
            type: 'mrkdwn',
            text: `*From:* <@${employee}>`,
          },
        },
        {
          type: 'section',
          text: {
            type: 'mrkdwn',
            text: `*Dates:* ${startDate} to ${endDate}`,
          },
        },
        {
          type: 'actions',
          block_id: 'approve-deny-buttons',
          elements: [
            {
              type: 'button',
              text: {
                type: 'plain_text',
                text: 'Approve',
              },
              action_id: 'approve_request',
              style: 'primary',
            },
            {
              type: 'button',
              text: {
                type: 'plain_text',
                text: 'Deny',
              },
              action_id: 'deny_request',
              style: 'danger',
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
    });
  } catch (err) {
    // Complete function with an error
    await complete({ error: `There was an issue: ${err}` });
    throw (err);
  }
};

// Let's register a new Slack function with notifyApprover as its handler
const requestApprovalFunc = new SlackFunction(ApprovalFunction.id, notifyApprover);

// Get our action handlers
const { approveActionHandler } = require('./actions/approve-action');
const { denyActionHandler } = require('./actions/deny-action');

// Add additional interactivity handlers
requestApprovalFunc
  .action('approve_request', approveActionHandler) // Support Regex
  .action({ action_id: /deny_*.+/ }, denyActionHandler); // Support constraint object

module.exports = { requestApprovalFunc };
```

### Views and modals {#views-and-modals}

Additional interactivity can be added in to your next-generation Slack app through [Modals](/bolt-js/concepts#creating-modals) and [Views](/bolt-js/concepts#updating-pushing-views). Within the Request Time Off example, we can add an additional button to the time off request message a manager receives that opens a new modal.

Having additional interactivity such as a modal could create a pathway for more functionality in the Request Time Off flow, such as allowing a manager to send a message to the requester to get additional information or clarification before approving or denying the request officially.

Let's dive in and see how we can add a new button that launches a simple modal with a corresponding view!

![Request Time Off demo with Open Modal button](../assets/take-your-time-open-modal.gif "Request Time Off demo with Open Modal button")

#### Add in new button to message

To start the flow, you'll first add a button to the time off request message that is sent to the manager when a request is submitted. In `listeners/functions/request-approval.js`, add in a new button block object to the end of the `blocks` array within the `client.chat.postMessage` request:
```js
  {
    type: 'button',
    text: {
        type: 'plain_text',
        text: 'Open a Modal',
      },
      action_id: 'open_modal',
      style: 'danger',
    },
```

Once this has been added in, when submitting a new time off request within your app, you should now see a red "Open Modal" button on time off request messages sent to the selected manager:
![Request Time Off message with Open Modal button](../assets/take-your-time-open-modal.png "Request Time Off message with Open Modal button")

#### Open a modal

[Modals](https://api.slack.com/block-kit/surfaces/modals) can be created by calling the `views.open` method. The method requires you to pass a valid [view payload](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/views).

To open or update a modal from a Slack function [interactivity handler](https://api.slack.com/future/view-events), you will also need to pass the `interactivity_pointer` within the `interactivity` object you received from your event payload in your `views.open` method.

To get started with creating a modal, add a new [Action](#action) that will be triggered when the "Open Modal" button is selected. Create a new file in `listeners/functions/actions` called `open-modal-action.js`:
```js
// listeners/functions/actions/open-modal-action.js
const openModalActionHandler = async ({ ack, client, body, complete }) => {
    ack();
    const { manager } = body.function_data.inputs;
    const { interactivity_pointer } = body.interactivity;
    try {
        await client.views.open({
            interactivity_pointer,
            view: {
                "type": "modal",
                "title": {
                    "type": "plain_text",
                    "text": "Random Modal",
                    "emoji": true
                },
                "submit": {
                    "type": "plain_text",
                    "text": "Submit",
                    "emoji": true
                },
                "notify_on_close": true,
                "close": {
                    "type": "plain_text",
                    "text": "Cancel",
                    "emoji": true
                },
                "callback_id": "submit_open_modal",
                "blocks": [
                    {
                        "type": "section",
                        "text": {
                            "type": "mrkdwn",
                            "text": `Hello <@${manager}>, you opened a random modal.`
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        })
    } catch (error) {
        complete({ error });
    }
  };

module.exports = { openModalActionHandler };
```
In this file, necessary data is deconstructed from the request `body`'s function data inputs, such as the `manager` property. The `interactivity_pointer` property, which is required to make the [`client.views.open`](https://api.slack.com/methods/views.open) API call, is also taken from the body's `interactivity` property.

With the necessary variables, the `client.views.open` API method is called, passing in the `interactivity_pointer` property as well as a Views Block Kit that defines the appearance of the modal as well as the callback ID, which is `submit_open_modal`.

With the handler for the "Open Modal" button now defined, it can be added as an action handler in `listeners/functions/request-approval.js`! In the section near the bottom of the `request-approval.js` file where the action interactivity handlers are called on `requestApprovalFunc`, import the `openModalActionHandler` and add an additional `.action()` for it:

```js
const { openModalActionHandler } = require('./actions/open-modal-action'); // add new import for open modal handler

// Add additional interactivity handlers
requestApprovalFunc
  .action('approve_request', approveActionHandler) // Support Regex
  .action({ action_id: /deny_*.+/ }, denyActionHandler) // Support constraint object
  .action('open_modal', openModalActionHandler); // Add new open modal action handler
```

#### Add in view handler

Now that the "Open Modal" button's action handler has been added in to the `request-approval.js` file, we can add in a view handler that will trigger additional functionality if the modal is submitted.

Inside `listeners/functions`, create a new directory called `views` and within it, add a new file called `modal-submit.js`:
```js
// listeners/functions/views/modal-submit.js
const openModalSubmissionHandler = async ({ ack, body, complete }) => {
    ack();
    const { manager, employee } = body.function_data.inputs;
    try {
      // add functionality here using `client.chat.postMessage` to send the employee who
      // submitted the request a message asking them for additional information on
      // their time off request
      complete();
    } catch (error) {
      complete({ error });
    }
  };

module.exports = { openModalSubmissionHandler };
```
Within this file, you can additional functionality&mdash;for example, you could add an API call to [`client.chat.postMessage`](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage) that will send a message to the requester of time off on behalf of the manager requesting that they DM the manager more information about wanting to take time off.

Once the desired functionality has been added in to the `openModalSubmissionHandler`, you can add it as an additional interactivity handler in `listeners/functions/request-approval.js`. To do so, import the view handler from `./views/modal-submit.js`:
```js
const { openModalSubmissionHandler } = require('./views/modal-submit');
```

Then, add a `.view()` handler to the `requestApprovalFunc` object that maps to the modal's callback ID, `submit_open_modal`:

```js
// Add additional interactivity handlers
requestApprovalFunc
  .action('approve_request', approveActionHandler) // Support Regex
  .action({ action_id: /deny_*.+/ }, denyActionHandler) // Support constraint object
  .action('open_modal', openModalActionHandler) // Support Regex
  .view({ callback_id: "submit_open_modal"}, openModalSubmissionHandler); // support view with callback id
```

By adding the `.view()` handler, you'll now be able to execute its logic when submitting the modal opened from the "Open Modal" button!
