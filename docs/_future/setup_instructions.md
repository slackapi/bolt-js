# Getting started <span class="label-beta">BETA</span>

<div class="section-content">
This guide will walk you though getting started with your Slack Developer Beta experience with Bolt JS. In this guide, you will install and set up the Slack CLI and also install required Node dependencies.
</div>

### Setting up the CLI {#setting-up-cli}

You'll first need to get the Slack CLI set up on your machine. You can follow the [Quickstart Guide](https://api.slack.com/future/quickstart) to get instructions on how to manually or automatically install it. 

Since we won't be using Deno in this guide, you can skip any instructions related to installing Deno or creating an app - once you've logged into the CLI using `slack auth login` and verified your login using `slack auth list`, you can proceed with the tutorial below.

> ðŸ’¡ When logging into a workspace using the CLI, we recommend using a workspace where you won't disrupt real work getting done â€” [you can create a new one for free](https://slack.com/get-started#create).

### Install dependencies {#install-dependencies}

Once the CLI is set up, make sure your machine has the most recent version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Depending on what operating system your machine uses, you can either install Node through a package manager (such as [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for Mac) or directly from the website.

Congratulations! You're now ready to start building using the Slack Developer Beta experience. ðŸŽ‰
