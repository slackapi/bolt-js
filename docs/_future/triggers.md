# Triggers <span class="label-beta">BETA</span>

<div class="section-content">
Triggers are but one of the three building blocks that make up next-generation Slack apps. You will encounter all three as you walk the path of building your Slack app:

1. Functions define the actions of your app
2. Workflows group functions into ordered steps
3. Triggers invoke workflows (‚¨ÖÔ∏è you are here)

Since triggers kick off workflows, you need to have a workflow before you can create a trigger. Acquaint yourself with the [documentation on workflows](/bolt-js/future/workflows), then head back here. We'll wait!

Once you've created a workflow, you can dive into the guide below!

### Create a trigger {#create}

Triggers can be added to workflows in two ways:

* [**You can add triggers with the CLI.**](#create_cli) These static triggers are created only once. You create them with the Slack CLI, attach them to your app's workflow, and that's that. 

* [**You can add triggers at runtime.**](#create_runtime) These dynamic triggers are created at any step of a workflow so they can incorporate data acquired from other workflow steps.

#### Create a trigger with the CLI {#create_cli}

**1. Create a trigger file**

Triggers created with the CLI are designed using trigger files. The trigger file you create will supply the information about how you want your trigger to work. **For Bolt for JavaScript apps, you will need to create JSON trigger files.**

The specifics of the trigger file's structure will depend on what [type of trigger](#types) you want to use.

The Hello World app from the Bolt for JavaScript starter template uses a link trigger, which is one of several [trigger types](#types). You can view its trigger file [here](https://github.com/slack-samples/bolt-js-starter-template/blob/future/triggers/hello-world-trigger.json).

**2. Run the** `trigger create` **command**

Use the `trigger create` command to create your desired trigger by pointing to a trigger file. 

```bash
slack trigger create --trigger-def "path/to/trigger.json"
```

> üí° In order to run the trigger and launch the full workflow, your application must be running via `slack run`.

<p class="alert alert_info"><ts-icon class="ts_icon_info_circle"></ts-icon>**Slack CLI built-in documentation**<br>
Use `slack trigger --help`  to easily access information on the `trigger` command's flags and subcommands.</p>

#### Create a trigger at runtime {#create_runtime}

The logic of a runtime trigger lies within a function's code. The specific payload is dependent on the [type of trigger](#types) you use.

Within your `manifest/functions` folder, you'll have the functions that are the steps making up your workflow. Within this folder is where you can create a trigger within the relevant `<function>.js` file. 

The `create` method for runtime triggers takes the form of `client.workflows.triggers.create()`. Within that method you can leverage `inputs` acquired in previous steps (i.e. with functions) within the workflow.

```js
const triggerResponse = await client.workflows.triggers.create({
  type: "shortcut",
  name: "My Trigger",
  workflow: "#/workflows/my_workflow",
  inputs: {
    input_name: {
      value: "value",
    }
  }
});
```

The response will have a property called `ok`. If `true`, then the trigger was created, and the `trigger` property will be populated.

Your response will include a `trigger.id`; be sure to store it! You will use that to `update` or `delete` the trigger if need be.

#### Development and production triggers

The triggers you create when you're running your app locally in a development environment (with the `slack run` command) will not work when you [deploy your app](/bolt-js/future/deploy-your-app). You'll need to `create` any triggers again with the CLI.

---

### Update a trigger {#update}

Make an update to a preexisting trigger by using the `slack trigger update` command. Provide the same payload you used to create the trigger *in its entirety*, in addition to the trigger ID.

```bash
slack trigger update --trigger-id Ft123ABC --trigger-def "path/to/trigger.json"
```
---

### Delete a trigger {#delete}

You can delete a trigger with the `slack trigger delete` command.

```bash
slack trigger delete --trigger-id FtABC123
```
---

### Trigger types {#types}

There are four types of triggers, each one having its own specific implementation. To learn more about each trigger, visit the linked pages below.

| Trigger Type                     | Use case                                                      |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Link triggers](https://api.slack.com/future/triggers/link)           | Invoke a workflow from anywhere in Slack                      |
| [Scheduled triggers](https://api.slack.com/future/triggers/scheduled) | Invoke a workflow at specific time intervals                  |
| [Event triggers](https://api.slack.com/future/triggers/event)         | Invoke a workflow when a specific event happens in Slack      |
| [Webhook triggers](https://api.slack.com/future/triggers/webhook)     | Invoke a workflow when a specific URL receives a POST request |

### Manage access {#manage-access}

A newly created trigger will only be accessible to others inside a workspace once its creator has granted access.

To manage what user (or many users) have access to run your triggers, you'll use the `slack trigger access` command.

To learn more about this, visit the guide [here](https://api.slack.com/future/triggers#manage-access).
