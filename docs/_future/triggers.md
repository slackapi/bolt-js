# Triggers <span class="label-beta">BETA</span>

<div class="section-content">
Triggers are but one of the three building blocks that make up next-generation Slack apps. You will encounter all three as you walk the path of building your Slack app:

1. Functions are what define the actions of your app
2. Workflows are made up of Functions
3. Triggers are how Workflows are executed (‚¨ÖÔ∏è you are here)

Since Triggers kick off Workflows, you need to have a Workflow before you can create a Trigger. Acquaint yourself with the [documentation on Workflows](/bolt-js/future/workflows), then head back here. We'll wait!

Once you've created a Workflow, you can dive into the guide below!

### Create a Trigger {#create}

Triggers can be added to Workflows in two ways:

* [**You can add Triggers with the CLI.**](#create_cli) These static Triggers are created only once. You create them with the Slack CLI, attach them to your app's Workflow, and that's that. 

* [**You can add Triggers at runtime.**](#create_runtime) These dynamic Triggers are created at any step of a Workflow so they can incorporate data acquired from other Workflow steps.

#### Create a Trigger with the CLI {#create_cli}

**1. Create a Trigger File**

Triggers created with the CLI are designed using Trigger Files. The Trigger File you create will supply the information about how you want your Trigger to work. **For Bolt for JavaScript apps, you will need to create JSON trigger files.**

The specifics of the Trigger File's structure will depend on what [type of Trigger](#types) you want to use.

The Hello World app from the Bolt for JavaScript starter template uses a Link Trigger, which is one of several [Trigger types](#types). You can view its Trigger File [here](https://github.com/slack-samples/bolt-js-starter-template/blob/future/triggers/hello-world-trigger.json).

**2. Run the** `trigger create` **command**

Use the `trigger create` command to create your desired Trigger by pointing to a Trigger File. 

```bash
slack trigger create --trigger-def "path/to/trigger.json"
```

> üí° In order to run the trigger and launch the full workflow, your application must be running via `slack run`.

<p class="alert alert_info"><ts-icon class="ts_icon_info_circle"></ts-icon>**Slack CLI built-in documentation**<br>
Use `slack trigger --help`  to easily access information on the `trigger` command's flags and subcommands.</p>

#### Create a Trigger at runtime {#create_runtime}

The logic of a runtime Trigger lies within a Function's code. The specific payload is dependent on the [type of Trigger](#types) you use.

Within your `manifest/functions` folder, you'll have the Functions that are the steps making up your Workflow. Within this folder is where you can create a Trigger within the relevant `<function>.js` file. 

The `create` method for runtime Triggers takes the form of `client.workflows.triggers.create()`. Within that method you can leverage `inputs` acquired in previous steps (i.e. with Functions) within the Workflow.

```js
const triggerResponse = await client.workflows.triggers.create({
  type: "shortcut",
  name: "My Trigger",
  workflow: "#/workflows/my_workflow",
  inputs: {
    input_name: {
      value: "value",
    }
  }
});
```

The response will have a property called `ok`. If `true`, then the Trigger was created, and the `trigger` property will be populated.

Your response will include a `trigger.id`; be sure to store it! You will use that to `update` or `delete` the Trigger if need be.

#### Development and production Triggers

The Triggers you create when you're running your app locally in a development environment (with the `slack run` command) will not work when you [deploy your app](/bolt-js/future/deploy-your-app). You'll need to `create` any Triggers again with the CLI.

---

### Update a Trigger {#update}

Make an update to a preexisting Trigger by using the `slack trigger update` command. Provide the same payload you used to create the trigger *in its entirety*, in addition to the Trigger ID.

```bash
slack trigger update --trigger-id Ft123ABC --trigger-def "path/to/trigger.json"
```
---

### Delete a Trigger {#delete}

You can delete a Trigger with the `slack trigger delete` command.

```bash
slack trigger delete --trigger-id FtABC123
```
---

### Trigger types {#types}

There are four types of Triggers, each one having its own specific implementation. To learn more about each trigger, visit the linked pages below.

| Trigger Type                     | Use case                                                      |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Link Triggers](https://api.slack.com/future/triggers/link)           | Invoke a Workflow from anywhere in Slack                      |
| [Scheduled Triggers](https://api.slack.com/future/triggers/scheduled) | Invoke a Workflow at specific time intervals                  |
| [Event Triggers](https://api.slack.com/future/triggers/event)         | Invoke a Workflow when a specific event happens in Slack      |
| [Webhook Triggers](https://api.slack.com/future/triggers/webhook)     | Invoke a Workflow when a specific URL receives a POST request |

### Manage access {#manage-access}

A newly created Trigger will only be accessible to others inside a workspace once its creator has granted access.

To manage what user (or many users) have access to run your Triggers, you'll use the `slack trigger access` command.

To learn more about this, visit the guide [here](https://api.slack.com/future/triggers#manage-access).
