Workflow Steps from apps allow your app to create and process custom workflow steps that users can add using [Workflow Builder](https://api.slack.com/workflows).

A workflow step is made up of three distinct user events: 

- Adding or editing the step in a Workflow
- Saving or updating the step's configuration
- The end user's execution of the step

All three events must be handled for a workflow step to function.

Read more about workflow steps from apps in the [API documentation](https://api.slack.com/workflows/steps).
