You can listen to any [Events API event](https://api.slack.com/events) using the `event()` method after subscribing to it in your app configuration. This allows your app to take action when something happens in Slack, like a user reacting to a message or joining a channel.

The `event()` method requires an `eventType` of type string.

```javascript
const welcomeChannelId = 'C12345';

// When a user joins the team, send a message in a predefined channel asking them to introduce themselves
app.event('team_join', async ({ event, client, logger }) => {
  try {
    // Call chat.postMessage with the built-in client
    const result = await client.chat.postMessage({
      channel: welcomeChannelId,
      text: `Welcome to the team, <@${event.user.id}>! ðŸŽ‰ You can introduce yourself in this channel.`
    });
    logger.info(result);
  }
  catch (error) {
    logger.error(error);
  }
});
```
