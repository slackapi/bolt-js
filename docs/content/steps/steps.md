Steps from Apps are a deprecated feature.

Steps from Apps are different than, and not interchangeable with, Slack automation workflows. We encourage those who are currently publishing steps from apps to consider the new [Slack automation features](https://api.slack.com/automation), such as [custom steps for Bolt](https://api.slack.com/automation/functions/custom-bolt).

Please [read the Slack API changelog entry](https://api.slack.com/changelog/2023-08-workflow-steps-from-apps-step-back) for more information.

Steps from apps allow your app to create and process steps that users can add using [Workflow Builder](https://api.slack.com/workflows).

A step from app is made up of three distinct user events:

- Adding or editing the step in a Workflow
- Saving or updating the step's configuration
- The end user's execution of the step

All three events must be handled for a step from app to function.

Read more about steps from apps in the [API documentation](https://api.slack.com/legacy/workflows/steps).
