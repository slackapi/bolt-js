Custom functions allow your app to create and process workflow steps that users can add in Workflow Builder. 

We recommend using custom functions as a replacement for the deprecated Workflow Steps from Apps.

A custom function requires two components:

* [A function definition in the appâ€™s manifest](/concepts/defining-custom-functions)
* [A listener to handle the function execution event](/concepts/listening-to-custom-functions)
