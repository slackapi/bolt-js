# Deploying to AWS Lambda ‚ö°Ô∏è Bolt for JavaScript

> Slack app example for using the AwsLambdaReceiver of Bolt for JavaScript

## Overview

This is an example app that updates the [Getting Started ‚ö°Ô∏è Bolt for JavaScript app][bolt-app] to use the AwsLambdaReceiver and be deployed to [AWS Lambda][aws-lambda] using the [Serverless Framework][serverless-framework].
You can learn how to build this example app by following our üìö [Deploying to AWS Lambda guide][bolt-guide-aws-lambda].

Before you begin, you may want to follow our [Getting Started guide][bolt-guide] to learn how to build your first Slack app using the [Bolt for JavaScript framework][bolt-website].

## Getting started

1. [Set up AWS credentials](#1-set-up-aws-credentials)
1. [Set up local project](#2-set-up-local-project)
1. [Create a Slack app](#3-create-a-slack-app)
1. [Deploy to AWS Lambda](#4-deploy-to-aws-lambda)
1. [Update Slack app settings](#5-update-slack-app-settings)
1. [Test your Slack app](#6-test-your-slack-app)
1. [Develop on local machine](#7-develop-on-local-machine)

## 1. Set up AWS credentials

### Install and configure AWS CLI

Follow Amazon's guides to [install the AWS CLI v2 for macOS, Windows, or Linux][aws-cli-install] and [create a new IAM User][aws-cli-configure-user].

When you have the AWS CLI and user credentials, then configure your local machine with the command:

```zsh
aws configure
```

## 2. Set up local project

You can install the app's local development dependencies with the following command:

```zsh
npm install
```

You may also want to [install ngrok][ngrok-install] to start a local tunnel for local development.

Ensure you can correctly run the `serverless` command from your terminal. You may have to reference it from the `./node_modules/.bin/serverless` location within the project. If that still doesn't work, refer to the [Serverless Getting Started documentation][serverless-install] on how to install the Serverless framework.

## 3. Create a Slack app

### Create an app on api.slack.com

1. Go to https://api.slack.com/apps
1. Select **Create New App**
    * Name your app, _don't worry you can change it later!_
1. Select **OAuth & Permissions**
    1. Scroll down to **Bot Token Scopes**
    1. Add the following bot scopes:
        1. Add the scope `app_mentions:read`
        1. Add the scope `channels:history`
        1. Add the scope `chat:write`
        1. Add the scope `groups:history`
        1. Add the scope `im:history`
        1. Add the scope `mpim:history`
    1. Select **Install App to Workspace** at the top of the page

### Export environment variables

```zsh
export SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=<your-signing-secret> # Slack app settings > "Basic Information"
export SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=<your-xoxb-bot-token>      # Slack app settings > "OAuth & Permissions"
```

## 4. Deploy to AWS Lambda

Run the following the command to deploy to AWS Lambda:

```zsh
serverless deploy
# ...
# endpoints:
#  POST - https://d5c0t1xad4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/slack/events
```

_Please note the endpoint `https://{your-domain}.amazonaws.com/dev/slack/events` because we'll use it in the next section._

## 5. Update Slack app settings

Now that your Slack app is deployed, you can register your AWS Lambda endpoint with the Slack API:

1. Go to https://api.slack.com/apps
1. Select your app
1. Select **Event Subscriptions**
    1. Enable **Events**
    1. Set the **Request URL** to `https://{your-domain}.amazonaws.com/dev/slack/events`
    1. Scroll down to **Subscribe to Bot Events**
    1. Add the following bot events:
        - `app_mention`
        - `message.channels`
        - `message.groups`
        - `message.im`
        - `message.mpim`
    1. Select **Save Changes**

## 6. Test your Slack app

You can test your app by opening a Slack workspace and saying "hello" (lower-case):

> üí¨ hello
>
> ü§ñ Hey there @Jane!

_Remember, your app must be in the channel or DM where you say hello._

## 7. Develop on local machine

Open a terminal session to listen for incoming requests:

```zsh
serverless offline --noPrependStageInUrl
```

Open another terminal session to proxy Slack API requests locally:

```zsh
# -subdomain= is avalable only for paid accounts
ngrok http 3000 -subdomain=my-unique-name
```

Update your [Slack app settings][slack-app-settings] to use your ngrok address:
1. **Interactivity & Shortcuts**
    1. Set the **Request URL** to `https://my-unique-name.ngrok.io/slack/events`
1. **Event Subscriptions**
    1. Set the **Request URL** to `https://my-unique-name.ngrok.io/slack/events`

Follow the steps to [test your app](#6-test-your-slack-app).
